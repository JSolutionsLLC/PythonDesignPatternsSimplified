<h3 align="center">An Introduction by Example</h3>

<p>Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring problems in software design and development that provide a structured approach to creating maintainable, flexible, scalable code that promotes reuse.  This concept gained prominence with the 1994 book "Design Patterns:  Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software," where 23 design patterns were introduced that have become the foundation for object-oriented software design.
This book introduces each of the 23 design patterns using simple examples in the Python programming language.  Thus, allowing the user to quickly comprehend and utilize these patterns to enhance their Python applications!
</p>

<p>Each Python program has been tested using Python V3.12.</p>

<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<p>The 23 design patterns in the GoF book are categorized into three groups:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Creational Design Patterns:</b> These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexibility in the instantiation process. They promote loose coupling between classes and their instances.
<ul>
<li>Abstract Factory</li>
<li>Factory Method</li>
<li>Builder</li>
<li>Prototype</li>
<li>Singleton</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Structural Design Patterns:</b> Structural patterns deal with class and object composition. They help define relationships between classes and simplify the design by making the system more flexible and efficient.</li>
<ul>
<li>Adapter</li>
<li>Bridge</li>
<li>Composite</li>
<li>Decorator</li>
<li>Facade</li>
<li>Flyweight</li>
<li>Proxy</li>
</ul>

<li><b>Behavioral Design Patterns:</b> Behavioral patterns concentrate on communication between objects and how they collaborate to achieve specific tasks. These patterns enhance the flexibility and extensibility of the system.</li>
<ul>
<li>Chain of Responsibility</li>
<li>Command</li>
<li>Interpreter</li>
<li>Iterator</li>
<li>Mediator</li>
<li>Memento</li>
<li>Observer</li>
<li>State</li>
<li>Strategy</li>
<li>Template Method</li>
<li>Visitor</li>
</ul>
</ul>
